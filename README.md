# cordova-plugin-tun2socks

This Cordova plugin provides the ability to start a system-wide VPN for Android devices.

We use [tun2socks](https://github.com/ambrop72/badvpn-googlecode-export/blob/master/tun2socks/badvpn-tun2socks.8) as an adapter; it receives all of the deviceâ€™s traffic through the VPN network interface (TUN) and forwards it to a SOCKS server.

To handle DNS resoution, we have implemented a local DNS resolver that intercepts DNS queries over UDP and proxies them over TCP (to Google Public DNS) through the SOCKS server.

### Target Devices

This plugin targets Android devices running Marshmellow (API 23), or higher. This requirement stems from calling `bindProcessToNetwork`, a [connectivity API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/ConnectivityManager.html#bindProcessToNetwork(android.net.Network)) introduced in version 23, which allows the client application traffic to bypass the VPN.

### Code Sources

We re-use and have used as a starting point open source code from [Psiphon](https://psiphon.ca/uz@Latn/open-source.html), specifically https://github.com/mei3am/ps.

 * `src/android`:
  * starting point: https://github.com/mei3am/ps/tree/master/Android/app
  * `Android/app/src/main/java/ca/psiphon/PsiphonTunnel.java` -> `src/android/org/uproxy/tun2socks/Tunnel.java`
  * `Android/app/src/main/java/com/psiphon3/psiphonlibrary/TunnelManager.java` -> `src/android/org/uproxy/tun2socks/TunnelManager.java`
  * `Android/app/src/main/java/com/psiphon3/psiphonlibrary/TunnelVpnService.java` -> `src/android/org/uproxy/tun2socks/TunnelVpnService.java`
 * `src/badvpn`:
  * built upon Psiphon's fork of [badvpn](https://github.com/ambrop72/badvpn).
  * starting point: https://github.com/mei3am/ps/tree/master/Android/badvpn
  * uProxy-specific changes mostly confined to tun2socks/tun2socks.c and marked with `// ==== UPROXY ====` (like Psiphon-specific changes)
 * `src/android/libs/jsocks.jar`:
  * http://jsocks.sourceforge.net/
